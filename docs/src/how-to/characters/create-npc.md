# Create an NPC

Create non-player characters for your campaigns and modules.

## Steps

1. Click **Characters** in the header
2. Click **+ New Character**
3. Select **NPC**

## NPC Properties

NPCs have simplified creation:

- **Name** - Character name
- **Role** - Their function (shopkeeper, quest giver, villain)
- **Description** - Physical appearance, personality
- **Notes** - Background, secrets, motivations

## Quick NPC Creation

For NPCs that don't need full stats:
1. Enter name and role
2. Add a brief description
3. Skip the full character wizard
4. Create immediately

## NPCs from Stat Blocks

For combat-ready NPCs:
1. Start with a monster stat block
2. Customize name and appearance
3. Add to module as an NPC token

## Assigning NPCs

NPCs can be assigned to:
- **Campaign** - Recurring characters across modules
- **Module** - Location-specific NPCs

## NPC vs Monster

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| NPC | Named characters with personality |
| Monster | Combat encounters, unnamed enemies |

Use NPCs for important characters the party interacts with socially.

## Tips

- Create NPCs during prep, not at the table
- Keep descriptions brief but memorable
- Include one distinctive trait or quirk
- Link to relevant plot threads in notes
