# Create an NPC

Create non-player characters for your campaigns and modules.

## Steps

1. Click **Characters** in the header
2. Click **+ New Character**
3. Select **NPC**

## NPC Creation

NPC creation is simplified — only a name is required:

1. Enter the NPC **Name**
2. Click **Create**

Additional details like race, class, role, and location can be edited after creation on the character detail view.

## Assigning NPCs

NPCs can be assigned to:
- **Campaign** - Recurring characters across modules
- **Module** - Location-specific NPCs

## NPC vs Monster

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| NPC | Named characters with personality |
| Monster | Combat encounters, unnamed enemies |

Use NPCs for important characters the party interacts with socially.

## Tips

- Create NPCs during prep, not at the table
- Keep descriptions brief but memorable
- Include one distinctive trait or quirk
- Link to relevant plot threads in notes
