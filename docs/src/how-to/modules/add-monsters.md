## Monster Search

The search includes:

## Placing Multiple Monsters

To add multiple of the same monster:
1. Search and select the monster
2. Click on the map to place each one
3. Each placement creates a new token

Or place one token and adjust quantities in the Token Inventory.

## Managing Monster Tokens

Placed monsters appear in the Token Inventory (right panel):
- Click to select on map
- Drag to reposition
- Click **×** to delete
- Right-click for more options
