## Steps

1. **Open the Campaign Selector** in the header bar
2. Click **+ New Campaign**
3. Fill in the campaign details:
   - **Campaign Name** (required) - A descriptive name
   - **Description** (optional) - Notes about your campaign
   - **Directory Location** (required) - Where to store campaign files
4. Click **Create Campaign**

You'll be redirected to your new campaign's dashboard.

## Campaign Directory

Mimir creates a subdirectory using a kebab-case version of your campaign name:

- Name: "Curse of Strahd" → Directory: `curse-of-strahd/`

This directory stores:
- Maps and images
- Exported documents
- Session notes
- Character data

## Tips

- Choose a consistent location for all campaigns (e.g., `~/Documents/Campaigns/`)
- Use descriptive names that help you identify campaigns later
- The description is only visible to you - use it for notes about themes, players, or status
