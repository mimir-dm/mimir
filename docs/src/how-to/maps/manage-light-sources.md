# Manage Light Sources

Light sources affect visibility in fog of war. This guide covers placing and controlling lights.

## Light Source Types

| Type | Bright Light | Dim Light |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Torch | 20 ft | 40 ft |
| Lantern | 30 ft | 60 ft |
| Candle | 5 ft | 10 ft |

## Placing Light Sources

1. Open Token Setup (click a map)
2. Find **Light Sources** in the Token Palette
3. Click a light type (Torch, Lantern, or Candle)
4. Click on the map to place

## Light Source Inventory

Placed light sources appear in the right panel under "Light Sources":
- Each light shows its type
- **Lit/Unlit** button toggles the light
- **×** button deletes the light

## Toggling Lights

### In Token Setup
Click the **Lit/Unlit** button next to any light source in the inventory.

### In Play Mode
Right-click a light source on the map to toggle it.

## How Lights Affect Visibility

- **Lit** - Expands visible area for all tokens
- **Unlit** - No effect on visibility
- Lights work with PC darkvision to determine what players see

## Use Cases

- **Torches on walls** - Simulate dungeon lighting
- **Lanterns with party** - Light source that moves with PCs
- **Candles on tables** - Ambient lighting for atmosphere

## Tips

- Place lights at choke points for dramatic reveals
- Toggle lights during play for effect (torch goes out!)
- Combine with ambient light settings for atmosphere
