# Pre-Session Preparation

Good sessions are built during the week, not improvised at the table. One hour of focused prep creates four hours of engaging play.

*Now that you've seen what happened in Session 1, let's prepare for Session 2 using our systematic approach.*

## The 8-Step Session Prep Process

At the heart of effective session preparation is a proven 8-step process that ensures you cover everything needed for a great game:

1. **Review Characters** - Current status and personal goals
2. **Create a Strong Start** - Hook players immediately
3. **Outline Potential Scenes** - Plan the session's flow
4. **Define Secrets and Clues** - Information management
5. **Develop Fantastic Locations** - Memorable settings
6. **Outline Important NPCs** - Bring the world to life
7. **Choose Relevant Monsters** - Appropriate challenges
8. **Select Magic Item Rewards** - Treasure and progression

This process takes 60-90 minutes to complete all 8 steps and create your working notes. With practice, veterans often finish in 60 minutes while new DMs may need the full 90.

## The Weekly Workflow

### Sunday (20 minutes): Capture Raw Notes

Right after the session, write down:
- What happened (player choices)
- Player reactions and theories
- Dangling threads
- What you forgot
- What surprised you

*Example from Ironhold Session 1*:
```
- Chose Path B (Deepguard Archive)
- Tom thinks Whisper Man = dragon
- Lisa wants to negotiate, not fight
- Forgot 3-day deadline until asked
- Marcus felt left out during investigation
```

### Monday (30 minutes): Create Prep Plan

Turn notes into actionable tasks:

```
MUST PREP:
- Deepguard Archive layout
- Keeper Morak stats & personality
- Negotiation mechanics for Lisa
- Deadline consequences

NICE TO HAVE:
- Torin's family details
- Dragon lore (if Tom asks)

SKIP:
- Path A and C content
- Random encounters
```

### Tuesday (15 minutes): Optional Touch Base

Light communication maintains momentum:
- Text: "Torin's daughter works at the Archive!"
- Discord: Share Morak character art
- Email: "Found those negotiation rules"

Skip if your group doesn't engage between sessions.

### Wednesday (60-90 minutes): Core Prep Work - The 8-Step Process

This is when you complete the 8-step session prep process. This creates your working notes:

**Steps 1-2 (10-15 minutes) - Foundation**:
1. **Review Characters**: Check HP, resources, personal goals
2. **Create Strong Start**: Design your opening scene with immediate decision

**Steps 3-4 (15-20 minutes) - Story Structure**:
3. **Outline Potential Scenes**: Plan 3-5 scenes sized for your session length
4. **Define Secrets and Clues**: Ensure critical info has multiple discovery paths

**Steps 5-6 (20-30 minutes) - World Elements**:
5. **Develop Fantastic Locations**: Create memorable spaces with interactive elements
6. **Outline Important NPCs**: Define appearance, personality, wants, and info

**Steps 7-8 (15-25 minutes) - Mechanical Elements**:
7. **Choose Relevant Monsters**: Select encounters and tactics
8. **Select Magic Item Rewards**: Plan treasure and story rewards

Total time varies based on complexity and experience. New DMs may need 90 minutes, veterans often finish in 60.

*Example from Session 2 prep:*

**Step 1 - Review Characters:**
```
Lisa (Cleric): Full HP, all spells, wants peaceful resolution
Marcus (Fighter): Down 8 HP, wants combat after being sidelined
Tom (Wizard): Full resources, theorizing about dragon connection
Sarah (Rogue): Full HP, needs more spotlight time
```

**Step 2 - Create Strong Start:**
```
Open mid-ritual! Morak raising glowing hammer, 3 rounds to impact
PCs must decide: interrupt, attack, or watch?
```

**Step 3 - Outline Scenes:**
```
1. Ritual Interruption (15 min) - Crisis decision
2. Confrontation/Investigation (45 min) - Learn truth
3. Vault Discovery (30 min) - Find evidence
4. Cliffhanger (10 min) - Seal weakening
```

**Step 4 - Define Secrets:**
```
Critical: Morak mistranslated "shatter" as "strengthen"
- Found via: Persuasion, examining books, or ritual completion
Critical: Goldbeards have a key-stone
- Found via: Vault letter, Morak's confession, or investigation
```

**Step 5 - Develop Locations:**
```
Ritual Chamber: Glowing circle, ancient tomes, cold draft
Hidden Vault: Behind tapestry, prayer-locked, contains truth
```

**Step 6 - Outline NPCs:**
```
Keeper Morak: Gaunt, whispers scripture, wants to purify
2 Acolytes: Nervous, flee if combat starts
```

**Step 7 - Choose Monsters:**
```
Animated Armor (if vault entered without prayer)
Environmental hazard: Disrupted ritual energy
```

**Step 8 - Select Rewards:**
```
Information: Truth about seals and Whisper Man
Letter: Goldbeard conspiracy evidence
Potions: 2 healing potions in vault
```

### Thursday (30 minutes): Transform Notes into One-Page Plan

This is when you convert your 8-step notes into the polished one-page session plan:

**First 10 minutes - Compile and Organize:**
- Combine all 8 steps into flowing narrative
- Arrange scenes in likely order
- Group NPCs and monsters together
- Consolidate clues into scene descriptions

**Next 10 minutes - Add Specifics:**
- Write opening narration
- Add DC numbers for all checks
- Include HP/AC for combat encounters
- Note page references for rules

**Final 10 minutes - Polish and Prepare:**
- Print handouts (riddle, letter)
- Bookmark/tab stat blocks
- Draw quick reference map
- Practice key NPC voices
- Create initiative tracker

### Friday: No Prep

Let your subconscious work.

### Saturday Morning (30 minutes): Pre-Game Ritual

```
10:00 - Review notes
10:10 - Set up space
10:15 - Queue music
10:20 - Practice voices
10:25 - Text players
10:30 - Breathe
```

## Emergency Prep (15 minutes)

When life happens, hit the essential elements from the 8-step process:

1. **Quick Character Check** (1 min) - Who's hurt? Who needs spotlight?
2. **Strong Start** (2 min) - Where are they? What's the immediate situation?
3. **Three Scenes** (6 min) - One combat, one social, one discovery
4. **One Critical Clue** (1 min) - What must they learn? Three ways to find it
5. **One Cool Location** (2 min) - Where's the interesting place?
6. **Two NPCs** (2 min) - Names, wants, one secret each
7. **One Combat** (1 min) - Who might they fight?
8. **One Reward** (1 min) - Treasure or information

This compressed version ensures you don't miss anything critical.

## From Notes to One-Page Plan

The 8-step process creates your raw notes (Wednesday). Thursday's transformation turns those notes into this polished one-page document—everything you need at the table. 

Here's how the Session 2 notes became the final plan:

```
SESSION 2: Saturday Oct 14 - The Deepguard Archive

LAST TIME: Party descended into Deepguard Archive. Session ended with 
Morak raising glowing hammer over forge-flame replica: "Tonight, we 
cleanse the corruption forever!" 3 days remain until clan moot.

OPENING: 
"The ritual chamber glows with ethereal light. Keeper Morak stands 
before the forge-flame replica, the hammer pulsing with divine energy. 
He hasn't noticed you yet. The chanting grows louder: 'Ancestors, 
purify your children!' The hammer rises higher..."
→ "What do you do?"

LIKELY SCENES:

1. Immediate Intervention (10-15 min)
   MORAK'S RITUAL IN PROGRESS:
   - 3 rounds until hammer strikes
   - 2 acolytes chanting in corners
   - Ritual circle glowing (don't break it!)
   - Ancient tomes open on pedestals around the circle
   - One massive book beside Morak with visible runes
   
   IMMEDIATE OPTIONS:
   - Shout/Interrupt (Morak pauses, demands explanation)
   - Rush forward (Initiative! But Morak not hostile yet)
   - Watch and wait (Ritual completes - see below)
   - Lisa's diplomacy (Persuasion with advantage if respectful)
   
   IF RITUAL COMPLETES:
   - Hammer strikes forge-flame with thunderous crack
   - Building shakes violently (DEX save DC 12 or fall prone)
   - Cracks spider-web across floor toward the north
   - Deep rumbling from below, then eerie silence
   - Morak collapses, weakened but alive
   - "What... what have I done? That's not... the ancestors..."
   - First seal is cracked (not shattered), Whisper Man stirs
   
2A. The Confrontation (45-60 min) - IF INTERRUPTED
   KEEPER MORAK:
   - "You dare interrupt sacred work?"
   - Genuinely believes he's saving Ironhold
   - WANTS: Strengthen failing seals through purification ritual
   - KNOWS: Ancient seals exist, brittle steel means they're weakening
   - WRONG: His ritual will shatter seals, not strengthen them (mistranslation)
   
   NEGOTIATION PATH (Lisa's preference):
   - Explain the real danger (DC 13 Persuasion)
   - Use scripture against him (DC 15 Religion)
   - Offer alternative ritual (need to find correct one)
   - Success: Morak horrified, becomes ally
   
   COMBAT PATH (if it goes bad):
   - Morak: Priest stats, casts spiritual weapon round 1
   - 2 Acolytes: Will flee if Morak loses half HP
   - Environmental: Disrupted ritual energy (random target, 2d6 radiant)
   - Victory: Must safely discharge ritual circle (Arcana DC 13)

2B. Emergency Investigation (45-60 min) - IF RITUAL COMPLETED
   MORAK COLLAPSED:
   - Weakened, confused, not hostile
   - "The seals... they cracked, not strengthened... what have I done?"
   - Willing to help if approached carefully
   - Can reveal: "The old texts... behind the Hammer of Founding..."
   
   THE RITUAL CHAMBER:
   - Perception DC 10: Ancient tapestry shows dwarves sealing a door
   - Perception DC 15: Tapestry hangs oddly, draft behind it
   - Investigation DC 12: Tapestry conceals stone door with prayer inscription
   - Arcana DC 12: Cracks pulse with otherworldly cold
   - Arcana DC 15: Seal magic is pre-imperial, binding something IN
   
   THE HIDDEN VAULT:
   Door inscription: "Let none enter save those who speak the Watcher's Oath"
   - Religion DC 13: Recognize ancient guardian prayer
   - Without prayer: Glyph triggers (3d8 thunder) when door opens
   
   INSIDE THE VAULT:
   - 15x15 room, walls covered in proto-dwarvish runes
   - Center: Pedestal with iron-bound tome
   - Corner: Ancient dwarven armor (eyes glow if tome touched)
   
   THE ANIMATED ARMOR:
   - Dormant until someone touches/takes the tome
   - Morak knows: "Speak your purpose to the Guardian"
   - If stated honestly: Guardian makes Insight check at disadvantage (DC = speaker's Deception/Persuasion)
   - Success: Armor nods, returns to dormancy
   - Failure: "DECEPTION!" Attacks (perfect for Marcus's combat need)
   - If defeated: Crumbles, whispers "The seals... must... hold..."
   
   ARMOR COMBAT:
   - Initiative: Armor animates with grinding metal sound
   - Round 1: Moves to block exit, attacks nearest person
   - Tactics: Focuses on whoever holds/touched the tome
   - Environment: Confined space (difficult to flank)
   - Special: If reduced to half HP, helm falls off revealing emptiness
   - Victory: Can take tome, armor becomes inert pile
   - Combat length: Design for 3-4 rounds (Marcus gets spotlight)
   
   TOME REVELATIONS:
   - Title: "The Binding of the Whisper Man"
   - Reveals: Entity of pure corruption, turns hearts to evil
   - Shows: Three seal locations (one directly below archive!)
   - Critical: Each seal has a key-stone, all three needed
   - Recent addition: Loose paper with Goldbeard seal
     * "Brother, the first key is secured in our vault"
     * "The fools think we seek only treasure"
     * Dated three weeks ago, signed "G.G."
   
   COUNTER-RITUAL REQUIREMENTS:
   - Must be performed at each seal
   - Needs: Sacred forge-flame (not corrupted)
   - Needs: Willing sacrifice of something precious
   - Needs: All three key-stones properly aligned
   
   TIME PRESSURE:
   - Every 20 minutes: CON save DC 10 or level of exhaustion
   - Whispers getting louder (WIS save DC 12 or disadvantage)
   - 6 hours until crack widens beyond repair

3. Aftermath & Next Steps (30-45 min)
   IF MORAK CONVERTED:
   - Shows hidden vault with true histories
   - Reveals other factions want seals broken
   - Offers modified ritual to strengthen seals
   - Mentions sensing "something stirring below"
   
   IF MORAK DEFEATED:
   - Acolytes can be questioned
   - Journal reveals his research
   - Archive contains seal locations
   - Tremor hits - seal damaged but not broken
   
   URGENT DISCOVERIES:
   - Goldbeard Clan has been seeking the key-stones!
   - "G.G." = Grimnar Goldbeard (rival clan leader)
   - They already have one key, need all three
   - Other cities reporting similar steel failures
   - Timeline: 2 days until irreversible damage
   - Next lead: The Sunken Seal (closest one)

INFORMATION DELIVERY:
✓ Whisper Man identity (ancient corruption entity)
✓ Seal locations (three total, one beneath city)
✓ Morak's misunderstanding (thought seals trapped impurity)
✓ Goldbeard conspiracy (they have one key already)
□ Counter-ritual requirements (if they investigate fully)
□ Other cities affected (if they ask around)

CLIFFHANGERS:
- EARLY (2.5 hrs): Discovery of Goldbeard letter, "They're heading for the second seal tonight!"
- ON TIME (3.5 hrs): Deep rumbling below, Morak: "The Sunken Seal... something's testing it from below"
- RUNNING LATE (4 hrs): Temperature plummets, frost spreads, whispers echo: "Free... soon... free..."

STABILIZATION ENDING (if appropriate):
- Morak: "Wait! I may not have the full counter-ritual, but..."
- Emergency seal reinforcement (requires group effort)
- Tom channels arcane energy (Arcana DC 12)
- Lisa leads prayer components (Religion DC 10)
- Marcus holds circle stable (Athletics DC 13)
- Sarah provides divine focus (Medicine DC 11)
- Success: Buys 3 days (maybe less - roll secretly)
- Morak exhausted: "The Goldbeards have three weeks head start..."

COMBAT STATS READY:
- Keeper Morak: Priest (MM 348) + 3rd level spells
- Acolytes: Standard (MM 342)
- Animated Armor: Standard (MM 19) - guards the vault
- Glyph of Warding: 3d8 thunder, DC 15 Dex save - protects vault entrance

MARCUS FOCUS:
- Animated armor fight (he wanted combat)
- Let him lead temple guard interaction
- Physical challenge: Crumbling archive section

REMINDERS:
- Lisa wants to negotiate (give her the chance)
- Tom suspects dragon connection (leave hints)
- Marcus felt left out (include action moments)
- Mention the 3-day deadline again
- Morak is sympathetic, not evil

IF PLAYERS FLEE:
- Ritual completes if they don't return within 10 minutes
- Thunderous CRACK echoes across district
- Street cracks in spiderweb pattern northward
- Archive windows shatter outward
- Temperature drops 20 degrees instantly
- Crowds panic: "The deep cold! Just like the old stories!"
- Guards arrive, establish perimeter
- Morak staggers out, horrified: "What have I done?"
- Party can re-enter as "concerned citizens" or reveal involvement
```

This is what you actually bring to the table—your complete session kit:

**The One-Page Plan**: Everything above, printed or on screen, always visible.

**NPC Cards** (one per major NPC):
```
KEEPER MORAK
Wants: Purify corruption through ritual
Voice: Whispers, quotes scripture constantly  
Key Info: Thinks seals trap evil, not contain it
Stats: Priest (MM 348), spiritual weapon, hold person
If pressed: "The ancestors demand purity!"
```

**Maps** (if your group uses them):
- Archive layout: Entry hall → Ritual chamber → Hidden vault
- Simple relationship map: Morak ← serves → Deepguard Faith
- Seal locations marked on city map

**Quick Reference**:
- Bookmark: Priest stats in Monster Manual
- Sticky note: Page with glyph of warding rules
- Index card: Archive riddle written out
- Phone/tablet: Atmospheric music queued

The key is everything stays accessible without shuffling papers mid-scene.

## The 8-Step Process in Practice

Notice how the raw notes transform into the polished plan:

**From Step 1 Notes**: "Marcus down 8 HP, wants combat" → Becomes environmental attack opportunity and animated armor encounter

**From Step 2 Notes**: "Open mid-ritual, 3 rounds" → Becomes full opening narration with immediate decision

**From Step 3 Notes**: "4 scenes planned" → Becomes structured scenes with time estimates and contingencies

**From Step 4 Notes**: "Morak mistranslated" → Becomes embedded clues in dialogue and book descriptions

**From Step 5 Notes**: "Ritual chamber, hidden vault" → Becomes detailed location descriptions with interactive elements

**From Step 6 Notes**: "Morak: gaunt, whispers" → Becomes full NPC card with dialogue and reactions

**From Step 7 Notes**: "Animated armor" → Becomes tactical encounter with environment details

**From Step 8 Notes**: "Letter, potions" → Becomes integrated rewards within scene flow

The transformation from notes to one-page plan is what makes your prep usable at the table. Your module provides the content foundation; this process creates your session-specific action plan.

## Weekly Time Investment Summary

Total weekly prep time: 2.5-3 hours
- Sunday: 20 minutes (capture raw notes)
- Monday: 30 minutes (create prep plan)
- Tuesday: 15 minutes (optional touch base)
- Wednesday: 60-90 minutes (8-step process)
- Thursday: 30 minutes (transform to one-page plan)
