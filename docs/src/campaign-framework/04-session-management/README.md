# Running the Game

Great sessions don't happen by accident. This section covers the skills and techniques for running modules effectively—the preparation, execution, and continuity work that transforms written content into memorable play.

## Modules vs Sessions

**Modules** are the content unit—complete, runnable adventures with everything needed to play: encounters, NPCs, locations, and narrative structure. You've already created these using the module templates.

**Sessions** are the play time—the 3-4 hours when you and your players actually meet. A single module might span multiple sessions, or you might run through portions of different modules in one session.

This section focuses on the DM skills needed to bridge that gap: turning prepared content into live play.

## The Three Phases

Every game session involves:

### [Pre-Session Preparation](./session-before.md)
The time between sessions determines success. Learn the workflow that turns focused prep into engaging play. Covers reviewing your module, preparing for the specific session, and your pre-game ritual.

### [Running the Session](./session-during.md)
Where preparation meets improvisation. Master the techniques for strong openings, reading the room, managing different player types, and landing satisfying cliffhangers. Your guide to actual play.

### [Post-Session & Campaign Continuity](./session-after.md)
The 30 minutes after a session shapes the next one. Capture what matters, track the living world, and maintain campaign momentum. Tools for managing continuity without drowning in notes.

## Core Principles

**Modules provide structure, sessions provide energy** - Your module is the foundation; your session skills bring it alive.

**One hour of prep creates four hours of play** - if you prep the right things.

**The world moves without the players** - NPCs pursue goals, events unfold, consequences ripple.

**Tools over memory** - Simple tracking systems beat trying to remember everything.

**Energy management matters** - Both yours and your players' energy must be sustained.

## Start Here

To see these principles in action, we'll follow a complete example throughout this section:

**[Interlude: Session 1 Play-Through](./session-interlude.md)** - See what happened in Session 1 of our Brittle Steel mystery module, establishing the foundation we'll build on.

New DMs: After reading the interlude, begin with [Pre-Session Preparation](./session-before.md) to build sustainable habits.

Experienced DMs: Jump to whichever phase challenges you most.

The three phases work together—master all three for consistently excellent sessions.
