# How to Use the Boards - Plain Instructions

## The Two-Board System

Campaign management uses two boards:

1. **Campaign Board** - Tracks the big picture (whole campaign lifecycle)
2. **Module Board** - Tracks adventure content (runnable modules)

Sessions are when you actually play—they're not a planning layer. A module might take 1 session or 6 sessions to complete; that's determined by your players, not your planning.

## Starting a Campaign

**You start with the CAMPAIGN BOARD in Concept stage.**

During Concept stage, you create:
- Campaign spark ideas (on index cards)
- **Campaign Pitch** (1 page)
- **Big Three Document** (1 page)
- **First Module Outline** (1-2 pages)

You're ready to move to Session Zero stage when:
- Players read Campaign Pitch and show interest

---

**In CAMPAIGN BOARD Session Zero stage**, you create:
- **Starting Scenario** (1-2 pages)
- **World Primer** (2-3 pages)
- **Character Guidelines** (1 page)
- **Table Expectations** (1 page)
- **Character Integration Forms**
- **Session Zero Packet** (compiled from above)

You're ready to move to Integration stage when:
- Session Zero is complete

---

**In CAMPAIGN BOARD Integration stage**, you create:
- **Campaign Bible** (themes, world, rules)
- **Character Integration Notes** (from Session Zero forms)
- **Major NPCs Document**
- **World Events Timeline**

**NOW you start using the MODULE BOARD for the first time.**

You're ready to move Campaign Board to Active stage when:
- First module launches (first session runs)

---

## Managing Modules

**In MODULE BOARD Backlog stage** (starts after Session Zero), you create:
- Module concept cards (based on PC interests)

You're ready to move a module to Planning stage when:
- Current module is nearly complete (or immediately after Session Zero for first module)

---

**In MODULE BOARD Planning stage**, you create:
- **Module Overview** with front matter (monsters, NPCs, items references)

You're ready to move to Development stage when:
- Module Overview is complete with all catalog references

---

**In MODULE BOARD Development stage**, you create:
- **Adventure Content** (read-aloud text, encounter details)
- **Locations** (maps, descriptions)
- **Clues & Information** (what players can discover)
- **DM Notes** (pacing, scaling, troubleshooting)

You're ready to move to Ready stage when:
- Module is complete and runnable

---

**In MODULE BOARD Ready stage**, you:
- Final review of module content
- Ensure all materials are ready (handouts, maps, stat blocks)
- System syncs front matter to separate monsters.md, npcs.md, items.md files

You're ready to move Module to Active stage when:
- You begin running the module

---

**In MODULE BOARD Active stage**, you:
- Run the module over however many sessions it takes
- Capture **Play Notes** after each session
- Track what happened for continuity

You're ready to move Module to Complete stage when:
- The module's story is resolved (however that happens)

---

**In MODULE BOARD Complete stage**, you create:
- **Post-Module Notes** (what happened, consequences, threads for next module)
- Update **Campaign Bible** with new established facts
- Archive the module

---

## Running Sessions

Sessions aren't planned—they happen. Here's the workflow:

### Before Each Session (1-2 hours prep)
1. Review where you are in the active module
2. Note which scenes/encounters are likely next
3. Prep NPCs who might appear
4. Gather materials (maps, handouts, stat blocks)

### During the Session
Run the module content, adapting to player choices.

### After Each Session (10-15 minutes)
Create **Play Notes** capturing:
- What happened
- Player reactions
- Dangling threads
- DM notes for next time

For detailed guidance on running sessions, see [Running the Game](./04-session-management/README.md).

## The Two Binders Pattern

1. **Campaign Binder** - Created during Integration stage
2. **Module Binder** - Created during Development stage

Each binder contains the documents created at that board level.

## Key Rules

- You don't touch Module Board until after Session Zero
- Campaign Board tracks big picture (whole campaign)
- Module Board tracks adventure content (runnable modules)
- Sessions are play time, not planning units
- A module takes as many sessions as it takes
