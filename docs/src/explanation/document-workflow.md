# Document Workflow

How Mimir's stage-based document system helps you track preparation progress.

## The Challenge

Preparing a D&D session involves many pieces:
- Maps to upload
- Monsters to add
- Descriptions to write
- Notes to organize

Without structure, it's easy to lose track of what's ready and what still needs work.

## Stage-Based Progression

Documents in Mimir progress through stages:

### Draft
Initial creation:
- Just started
- Rough notes
- Placeholder content

### Review
Ready for revision:
- Content complete
- Needs polish
- Check for consistency

### Complete
Ready for play:
- Finalized content
- All details filled in
- Session-ready

## Visual Tracking

The document sidebar shows:
- Documents grouped by stage
- Visual indicators for completion
- Progress at a glance

## Templates

Mimir provides templates for common document types:

### Session Notes
- Pre-session prep section
- During-session notes
- Post-session recap

### Location Description
- Overview
- Key features
- Secrets and discoveries

### Encounter Plan
- Setup and trigger
- Combatants
- Tactics
- Rewards

### NPC Profile
- Appearance
- Personality
- Goals and motivations
- Useful information

## Workflow Benefits

### Clear Progress
See exactly what's ready:
- Incomplete documents need attention
- Complete documents are session-ready
- No guessing about preparation status

### Prioritization
Focus on what matters:
- Work through drafts
- Review before sessions
- Mark complete when done

### Confidence
Know you're prepared:
- All complete = ready to play
- Incomplete = still working
- Review = almost there

## Practical Tips

### Before First Session
1. Create key documents as drafts
2. Fill in essential content
3. Mark complete when ready

### Ongoing Preparation
1. Add drafts as ideas come
2. Review and polish before sessions
3. Complete what you'll need

### During Play
1. Session notes auto-save
2. Add observations and outcomes
3. Reference prepared content

## Document vs Session Notes

### Prepared Documents
- Written before play
- Reference material
- Encounter plans, descriptions

### Session Notes
- Written during play
- Real-time capture
- HP tracking, events, decisions

Both have their place in your workflow.
