# Campaigns vs Modules

Understanding Mimir's two-level hierarchy for organizing your D&D games.

## The Problem

When preparing a D&D campaign, you're managing two different scopes:

1. **Campaign-level** - The overarching story, recurring characters, world lore
2. **Adventure-level** - Specific dungeons, encounters, session content

Mixing these creates chaos: Where do you put the goblin boss? Under the campaign? But he's only in this dungeon. What about the recurring villain? She appears in multiple adventures.

## Mimir's Solution

Mimir separates these concerns:

**Campaigns** contain:
- World-building and lore
- Recurring NPCs
- Player characters
- The overarching story

**Modules** contain:
- Specific adventures
- Maps and encounters
- Location-specific monsters
- Session prep documents

## Why This Works

### Reusability
A module like "Goblin Cave" can be:
- Used in multiple campaigns
- Run for different groups
- Adapted and improved over time

### Focus
When preparing for Tuesday's session:
- Open the relevant module
- See only what you need
- Don't wade through campaign-wide content

### Organization
As your campaign grows:
- Add new modules without cluttering old ones
- Archive completed adventures
- Track progress by module

## Practical Examples

### A Published Adventure

Running "Lost Mine of Phandelver":
- **Campaign**: "Phandelver Campaign"
- **Module 1**: "Goblin Arrows" (ambush + Cragmaw Hideout)
- **Module 2**: "Phandalin" (town exploration)
- **Module 3**: "Cragmaw Castle"
- **Module 4**: "Wave Echo Cave"

### A Homebrew Campaign

Your original world:
- **Campaign**: "The Shattered Realms"
- **Module 1**: "The Haunted Mine" (first adventure)
- **Module 2**: "Festival of Shadows" (town event)
- **Module 3**: "Dragon's Lair" (climax)

### One-Shots

Even one-shots benefit:
- **Campaign**: "One-Shot Collection"
- **Module 1**: "Goblin Heist"
- **Module 2**: "Murder Mystery"
- **Module 3**: "Dragon Hunt"

## When to Use Each

### Put in the Campaign
- Setting information
- Recurring NPCs
- Player character assignments
- World maps
- Faction details

### Put in the Module
- Dungeon maps
- Encounter monsters
- Location-specific NPCs
- Session prep documents
- Read-aloud text

## The Boundary Cases

Some content could go either way:

**Major villain** - Campaign NPC, appears in multiple modules
**Dungeon boss** - Module monster, only in that adventure
**Town shopkeeper** - Could be either, depends on recurrence

When in doubt: If you'll reference it in multiple modules, put it in the campaign. If it's session-specific, put it in the module.

## Benefits for Long Campaigns

As campaigns run for months or years:
- Modules act as "chapters" you can reference
- Old modules preserve their state
- New modules start fresh
- Campaign-level content evolves
