# The Two-Board System

How Mimir's campaign and module boards help you manage preparation.

## Origin

The Two-Board System comes from Kanban methodology, adapted for D&D preparation. Instead of one overwhelming to-do list, you have structured workflows at two levels.

## Campaign Board

The Campaign Dashboard organizes high-level work:

### Campaign Tab
World-building and setting:
- Lore documents
- Faction descriptions
- World maps
- Historical notes

### Modules Tab
Adventure management:
- List of all modules
- Module status tracking
- Quick access to prep and play

### NPCs Tab
Recurring characters:
- Major NPCs
- Villains
- Allies and contacts

### PCs Tab
Player characters:
- Character assignments
- Quick access to sheets

## Module Board

Each module has its own preparation space:

### Documents
Session-specific prep:
- Encounter plans
- Read-aloud text
- Location descriptions

### NPCs
Location-specific characters:
- Quest givers
- Shopkeepers
- Informants

### Maps
Battle and area maps:
- Dungeon layouts
- Encounter locations
- Token placements

### Dangers
Monsters and hazards:
- Encounter creatures
- Traps and hazards
- Grouped by location

## Workflow Philosophy

### Prepare Once, Use Forever

Campaign content persists across modules:
- Write the villain's backstory once
- Reference from any module
- Update as the story evolves

### Module-Focused Sessions

When running a session:
- Enter Play Mode for the specific module
- Everything you need is there
- No digging through campaign-wide content

### Progressive Preparation

You don't have to prepare everything:
1. Create campaign with basic info
2. Add first module with first session content
3. Expand as you play
4. Add modules as needed

## Information Flow

### Campaign → Module
- NPCs can be assigned to modules
- Campaign PCs appear in Play Mode
- Setting context informs module content

### Module → Campaign
- Session notes inform campaign evolution
- Completed modules become campaign history
- NPCs discovered in modules can become recurring

## Benefits

### Reduced Overwhelm
- See only what's relevant
- Clear boundaries between content
- Focus on current needs

### Better Organization
- Everything has a place
- Easy to find content
- Consistent structure

### Flexible Preparation
- Prepare deeply or lightly
- Add detail as needed
- Skip what you don't need
