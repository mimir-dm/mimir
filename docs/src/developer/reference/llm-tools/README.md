# LLM Tools (Removed)

The built-in LLM tools system was removed in v0.5.0. AI-assisted campaign management is now provided through the **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** in the `mimir-mcp` crate.

See the [MCP server plugin documentation](../../../../crates/mimir-mcp/plugin/README.md) for details on available tools and integration with Claude Code.
