## 8. DM Notes

### Pacing

- Let players theorize - don't rush to the answer
- Drop clues at a steady pace, accelerate near the end
- If players are stuck, have a new incident occur
- The "aha moment" should feel earned

### Running Investigations

- Present information, don't solve the puzzle for them
- Reward creative questioning and approaches
- Have NPCs react to player theories (some correctly, some not)
- Use Investigation vs. Insight for different discoveries

### Common Pitfalls

- **Players fixate on wrong suspect:** Have that suspect do something that proves innocence (while players watch)
- **Players are completely stuck:** A new witness comes forward, or the culprit makes a mistake
- **Players guess too quickly:** Add a layer - they're right about who but wrong about why

### Scaling

- **Shorter Mystery:** Reduce suspects to 2, compress timeline
- **Longer Mystery:** Add more layers, false conclusions, rival investigators
