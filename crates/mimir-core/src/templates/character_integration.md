## Party Connections

*Each PC should have a connection to at least two others*

### Connection Web
Draw lines between characters, noting their relationships:

```
[Character 1] ←→ [Character 2]: [How they know each other]
[Character 1] ←→ [Character 3]: [How they know each other]
[Character 2] ←→ [Character 3]: [How they know each other]
[Character 2] ←→ [Character 4]: [How they know each other]
[Character 3] ←→ [Character 4]: [How they know each other]
[Character 4] ←→ [Character 1]: [How they know each other]
```

### Optional Connection Templates
If players struggle, offer these:
- "We survived [traumatic event] together"
- "We both owe [NPC] a debt"
- "We're related by [blood/marriage/adoption]"
- "We worked for [organization] together"
- "We share a secret about [event/person/thing]"
- "We both seek [person/item/knowledge]"

---

## Group Identity

**Party Name:** [If they want one]  
**Shared Element:** [What unites them - patron, goal, history]  
**Group Resource:** [Shared base, vehicle, patron, etc.]  
**Reputation:** [How others see them, if established]

**The Reason We Stay Together:**
[One sentence everyone agrees on]
