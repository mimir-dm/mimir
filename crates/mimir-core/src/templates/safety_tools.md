## How to Use Safety Tools

### During Play
- **X-Card**: Tap the table, say "X", or use the signal your table agreed on
- **No explanation required**: You don't need to say why
- **Scene adjustment**: The GM will either edit the scene, skip ahead, or take a break
- **No judgment**: Using safety tools is always the right call

### Between Sessions
- **Check-ins**: Brief discussion at session start about comfort levels
- **Private feedback**: Message the GM if something bothered you
- **Adjustments**: Lines and veils can be added at any time

## Content Warnings
The GM will provide advance warning for:
- Major character death or permanent harm
- Topics adjacent to the veils list
- Significant tone shifts (horror elements, etc.)

## Remember
- These tools exist to keep the game fun for everyone
- Using them shows trust, not weakness
- A good session is one where everyone feels comfortable
