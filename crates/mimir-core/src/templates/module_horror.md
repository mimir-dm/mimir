## 4. Corruption Mechanics

### Environmental Corruption

Track how the location changes as the horror spreads:

| Level | State | Effects |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0 | **Normal** | Tense atmosphere, nothing visible |
| 1 | **Unsettling** | Wrong details - shadows wrong way, colors muted |
| 2 | **Corrupted** | Obvious supernatural - reality fraying |
| 3 | **Nightmare** | Environment hostile - walls bleed, gravity shifts |
| 4 | **Hellscape** | Horror's domain - survival only |

**Corruption Advances When:**
- Horror claims a victim: +1
- PCs fail to contain spread: +1
- Significant time passes: +1
- Horror achieves key goal: +2

### Stress Tracking

Track individual character stress (0-10):

| Stress | Status | Effects |
|--------|--------|---------|
| 0 | **Stable** | Normal function |
| 1-3 | **Shaken** | Disadvantage on one type of check (player choice) |
| 4-6 | **Frightened** | As shaken + 1 level exhaustion |
| 7-9 | **Breaking** | Short-term madness effect (1d10 minutes) |
| 10 | **Broken** | Long-term madness, permanent consequence |

**Gaining Stress:**
- Witness horror (not violence - wrongness): +1
- Ally harmed or killed: +2
- Direct encounter with entity: +2
- Sanity-breaking revelation: +3
- Failed save against fear: +1

**Reducing Stress:**
- Complete rest in genuinely safe place: -1

### Part 1: Unease (Stage 1)

**Setup:** PCs encounter the first signs that something is wrong

> **Read Aloud:**
> "[Description of the initial setting - beautiful, familiar, normal. But describe one thing that's slightly wrong. A smell that shouldn't be there. Silence where there should be sound. A shadow that doesn't match its source. Let the players notice it themselves if possible.]"

### Part 2: Fear (Stage 2)

**Setup:** The horror becomes undeniable - normal explanations fail

## 8. DM Notes

### Pacing Horror

**Opening:** Normal scene with one wrong detail
**Development:** Investigation with building unease
**Climax:** Horror encounter or sanity-breaking revelation
**Denouement:** Brief safety before next stage

### Building Dread

- Start subtle - let players scare themselves
- Use environment before showing monsters
- Make familiar things threatening
- Describe absence (silence, cold, emptiness)
- Focus on wrong details, not gore
- Use all senses, especially smell
- Leave gaps for imagination
- Contrast beauty with horror
- Break tension occasionally (relief makes horror worse)

### Player Techniques

- Split the party carefully (terrifying but risky)
- Remove expected resources (magic doesn't work as expected)
- Make dice rolls ominous (natural 1 on Perception...)
- Use real-time pressure sparingly
- Reward paranoia occasionally

### Safety Considerations

**Session Zero Requirements:**
- Establish lines and veils
- Discuss phobias to avoid
- Create safety signals (X-card, verbal check)
- Agree on intensity level
- Plan tone breaks

**During Play:**
- Watch player (not character) reactions
- Pause if anyone seems uncomfortable
- Debrief after intense scenes
- Separate player experience from character
- End sessions in calmer moments when possible

**After Sessions:**
- Check in with players
- Adjust intensity as needed
- Celebrate survival together

### Scaling Horror

- **Lighter Horror:** Reduce body count, add more comic relief, clear victory possible
- **Intense Horror:** Higher stakes, fewer escapes, lasting consequences
- **Survival Horror:** Resource scarcity, anyone can die, victory costs everything

### Common Pitfalls

- **Too much too fast:** Horror needs slow build - rushing kills dread
- **Gore over atmosphere:** Wrongness is scarier than violence
- **Invincible horror:** Must have some path to victory or players disengage
- **Player discomfort:** Check in regularly, respect limits
- **Hopelessness:** Small victories maintain engagement
