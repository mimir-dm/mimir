# D&D 5e Treasure Guidelines

## Starting Equipment Value by Level

| Level | Low Wealth | Typical | High Wealth |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 1-4 | 50-100 gp | 100-500 gp | 500-1,000 gp |

| 17-20 | 20,000-50,000 gp | 50,000-200,000 gp | 200,000+ gp |

These are cumulative totals per character, not per-session awards.

## Magic Items by Tier

| Tier | Levels | Expected Magic Items |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | 1-4 | Few common/uncommon consumables |
| 2 | 5-10 | Uncommon permanent items, some rare |
| 3 | 11-16 | Rare permanent items, some very rare |
| 4 | 17-20 | Very rare and legendary items |

## Magic Item Rarity and Value

| Rarity | Value Range | Typical Level |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Common | 50-100 gp | 1+ |
| Uncommon | 101-500 gp | 1+ |
| Rare | 501-5,000 gp | 5+ |
| Very Rare | 5,001-50,000 gp | 11+ |
| Legendary | 50,001+ gp | 17+ |
| Artifact | Priceless | 17+ |

## Item Type Distribution

A balanced party needs:
- **Weapons** for martial characters
- **Armor/defensive items** for frontline characters
- **Spellcasting focuses/components** for casters
- **Utility items** for exploration and social pillars
- **Consumables** (potions, scrolls) for resource recovery

## Attunement Budget

Each character can attune to a maximum of 3 items. When auditing, count total attunement items available vs. party size x 3.
